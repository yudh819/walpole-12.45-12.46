# walpole-12.45-12.46
data and r script for solving question 12.45 and 12.46 in walpole et al 9th edition

in 12.45 data, x1 for define van and x2 for define SUV

in 12.46 data, gender = 1 for male and 0 for female (it's doesnt matter if you define male as 0 since their size was same)

conclusion

12.45

a. MPG = 5.959-3.773(odometer)+0.3373(octane)-12.63(x1)-12.98(x2)

b. 4 door sedan have best MPG (see the MPG average each car type or you can see 
                              coefficient in x1 & x2 they appear negative hence,
                              they'll reduce the MPG if defined)

c. van and SUV not significantly different (see the MPG average for van and SUV)

12.46

a. profit = 30.18 + 0.005429(income)-235.9(gender)-49.53(fam member)

it's more profit for company to pick female customer since gender coef was big negative for profit

b. income doesn't matter since it have very small coef
